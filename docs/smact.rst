.. _smact_module:

smact Python package
====================

The core module of :mod:`smact` contains classes which are used as
fundamental data types within the smact package, as well as several
utility functions.
Particular attention is drawn to :func:`smact.element_dictionary`,
which returns a dictionary of :class:`smact.Element` objects indexed
by their chemical symbols.
Generating this dictionary once and then performing lookups is
generally the fastest way of accessing element data while enumerating
possibilities in chemical space.
