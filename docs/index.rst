Semiconducting Materials from Analogy and Chemical Theory
=========================================================

View the code on Github `here <http://github.com/wmd-group/smact>`_.

Introduction
============

:mod:`smact` is a collection of tools and examples for "low-fi" screening of
potential semiconducting materials through the use of chemical
rules.

:mod:`smact` uses a combination of heuristics and models derived from data to
rapidly search large areas of chemical space. This combination of methods
allows :mod:`smact` to identify new materials for applications such as photovoltaics,
water splitting and thermoelectrics.

Features of :mod:`smact` include:

- Chemical elements with associated properties
- Filters for oxidation states and charge balancing
- Structure predcition from chemical composition
- Composition probability prediction

Install
=======

The package is available *via* :code:`pip install smact`.
