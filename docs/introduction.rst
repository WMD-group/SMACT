============

:mod:`smact` is a collection of tools and examples for "low-fi" screening of
potential semiconducting materials through the use of simple chemical
rules.

:mod:`smact` uses a combination of heuristics and models derived from data to
rapidly search large areas of chemical space. This combination of methods
allows :mod:`smact` to identify new materials for applications such as photovoltaics,
water splitting and thermoelectrics. Read more about :mod:`smact` in our publications:

- `Computational Screening of All Stoichiometric Inorganic Materials <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929416301553>`_
- `Computer-aided design of metal chalcohalide semiconductors: from chemical composition to crystal structure <http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c7sc03961a>`_
- `Materials discovery by chemical analogy: role of oxidation states in structure prediction <http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/fd/c8fd00032h>`_

This approach is heavily inspired by the work of Harrison [1]_ and
Pamplin [2]_. The work is an active project in the `Walsh Materials Design Group <http://wmd-group.github.io>`_.

SMACT is now available *via* :code:`pip install smact`.

We are also developing a set of Jupyter notebook examples `here <https://github.com/WMD-group/SMACT/tree/master/examples>`_.
