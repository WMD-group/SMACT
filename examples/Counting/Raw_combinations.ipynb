    "# Generate raw combinations of elements or species \n",
    "This notebook aims to demonstrate the sheer scale of the combinatorial explosion. Based on some assumtions about how many elements (103) or species - elements in oxidation states - (403) there are, it calculates how many binary, ternary, quaternary... combinations there can be, within different integers stoichiometry limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "this notebook contains **ZERO** chemistry. \n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers that are produced match roughly to the raw combinations (before chemical filters) numbers obtained in Table 1 of the publication [Computational Screeningf of All Stoichiometric Inorganic Materials](https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(16)30155-3) (D. W. Davies et. al, Chem, 2016).\n",
    "Small deviations from the numbers are due to changes in what we class as an \"accessible\" oxidation state for some elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. It can take a minute or two to calculate quaternaries on a desktop/laptop computer. "
